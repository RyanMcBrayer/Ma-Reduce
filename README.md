# MapReduce
A multi-threaded implementation of the MapReduce programming model, designed using Linux libraries and C.

Note: This project was done as an assignment for my Operating Systems course. The header files, an example main.c that implements a word count program, and a single-threaded version of hashmap.c were provided. I was responsilbe for making a multi-threaded version of a MapReduce library in mapreduce.c, as well as modifying the provided hashmap.c to work with multithreading.
